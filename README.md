# qtrove

Qtrove is a python package offering programmatic access to qtrade.ca accounts.
This software is not affiliated in any way with qtrade.ca or its affiliates.

There is no published API for qtrade.ca at the time of this writing, so this
software pulls data from website content. We can expect some breakage as the
website changes.
