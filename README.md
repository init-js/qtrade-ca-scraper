# qtrove

Qtrove is a python package offering programmatic access to retrieve information
from their accounts on qtrade.ca. This software is not affiliated in any way
with qtrade.ca or its affiliates.

There is no published API for qtrade.ca at the time of this writing, so this
software retrieves the information by scraping the website. This has shortcomings
of course, one of which being that it is prone to breaking if the website changes.
